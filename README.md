# liri-node-app
This the Liri app. It is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface that works off of the command line.


Liri will allow users working on the command line to access data on music from Spotify, concerts from  Bands in Town, and movies from OMDB, without having to use a search engine or leave the command line. This will prevent the openning of new windows for searches that can be done simply and easily from the comfort of the command line.
